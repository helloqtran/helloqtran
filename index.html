            <h2>I find joy in <span class="highlight">the work I do.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>I work at <a href="http://www.fluxon.com" target="_blank">Fluxon</a>, a product development company trusted by both globally renowned brands and high-growth start-ups as a partner in designing, building and shipping world-class products.</p>
            <p>In my role as Operations Lead, I'm currently responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="small-highlight">Feedback</span>, designing and delivering on our approach to both individual and company feedback and growth</li>
                <li><span class="small-highlight">People Ops</span> for our Americas region, supporting all US + Canada team members across the full employee lifecycle</li>
                <li><span class="small-highlight">Community</span>, establishing our own community from the ground up</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Prior to joining Fluxon, I spent five years on the HR team at <a href="https://usa.visa.com/" target="_blank">Visa</a>. I started out in Visa's rotational HR Development Program, and then grew into strategy-based roles within the Global Talent team. During my tenure, I was most proud of redesigning our strategy and approach to employee recognition, doubling quarterly usage of our recognition platform from 31% to 76%.</p>
            <p>I'm drawn to complex and ambiguous problems, especially ones where I can uncover stories hidden in data.</p>
            <p>I enjoy working on presentations more than I'd like to admit.</p>

            <h2>I find joy in <span class="highlight">reading.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>I've made it a habit to read before bed every night instead of scrolling on my phone. I usually read two books at a time, one fiction and one non-fiction, so I can go back and forth between them depending on my mood. I read on a Kindle Paperwhite, and I use <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby" target="_blank">Libby</a> to borrow all of my books.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite fiction books are <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55710304-exhalation" target="_blank">Exhalation</a> by Ted Chiang, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42410904-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy" target="_blank">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> by Douglas Adams, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56609700-the-portrait-of-a-mirror" target="_blank">The Portrait of a Mirror</a> by A. Natasha Joukovsky.</p>
            <p>Non-fiction books I've really enjoyed include <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50781726-the-years-that-matter-most" target="_blank">The Years That Matter Most</a> by Paul Tough, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits" target="_blank">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40732657-the-power-of-moments" target="_blank">The Power of Moments</a> by Chip + Dan Heath.</p>
            <p>I have a soft spot for memoirs by AAPI women. I can't recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50196744-know-my-name" target="_blank">Know My Name</a> by Chanel Miller, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55577549-crying-in-h-mart" target="_blank">Crying in H-Mart</a> by Michelle Zauner, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56461570" target="_blank">Beautiful Country</a> by Qian Julie Wang highly enough.</p>
            <p>My favorite book of all time is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50033.Dandelion_Wine" target="_blank">Dandelion Wine</a> by Ray Bradbury. We were required to read (and annotate) this book in high school, and it's stuck with me ever since.</p>

        <div id="movement">
            <h2>I find joy in <span class="highlight">movement.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>I spent most of my life being terrified of fitness, so I feel really lucky to have found ways to be physically active that I genuinely love.</p>
            <p>I've done yoga on and off for about five years. You can find me every Saturday at my neighborhood yoga studio, <a href="https://www.yogamayu.com" target="_blank">Yoga Mayu</a>. I also highly recommend <a href="https://haumsf.com" target="_blank">HAUM SF</a>, which is the most beautiful space I've ever practiced in.</p>
            <p>In 2021, I started doing pole and have developed a moderate obsession. I take classes three times per week, so if I'm not at home, I'm most likely at my studio. I continue to be surprised by what my body is capable of, and I'm really proud of the upper body strength I've developed.</p>

        <div id="other">
            <h2>I find joy in <span class="highlight">a lot of other random things.</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Like many others, I learned how to knit during the pandemic. Unlike many others, I finally learned how to ride a bike during the pandemic.</li>
                <li>Every once in a while, I find the energy to host an elaborate dinner for my friends. These events have escalated rapidly - the last one took the form of a pop-up ramen restaurant in my apartment, complete with 2 different types of broth made from scratch, QR code menus, and me taking orders on an iPad.</li>
                <li>I started learning Mandarin in 2022 and take lessons with a tutor twice a week (<span id="chinese">可是，我的中文還說的不好</span>).</li>
                <li>I'm a sucker for miniature things.</li>
                <li>I'm also a sucker for kitschy things - one of my most prized possessions is a popsicle purse from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rommydebommy/" target="_blank">Rommy de Bommy</a>, which I unfortunately broke during a move.</li>
                <li>When I want some background noise, I usually look for video essays on Youtube (four-hour deep-dives on teen sitcoms from the 00's are my guilty pleasure).</li>
            </ul>
