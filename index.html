            <h2>I find joy in <span class="highlight">the work I do.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>I currently work at <a href="http://www.fluxon.com" target="_blank">Fluxon</a>, a product development company trusted by both globally renowned brands and high-growth start-ups as a partner in designing, building and shipping world-class products.</p>
            <p>In my role as Operations Lead, I wear several hats:</p>
            <li><span class="small-highlight">Feedback and Growth Lead</span>/team of 1, designing and delivering on our approach to both individual and company feedback and growth</li>
            <li><span class="small-highlight">People Operations Lead</span>/team of 1 for our Americas region, supporting all of our team members across the US + Canada, across the full employee lifecycle</li>
            <li><span class="small-highlight">Community Lead</span>, responsible for establishing our own community from the ground up</li>
            <br>
            <p>Prior to joining Fluxon, I spent just over five years on the HR team at <a href="https://usa.visa.com/" target="_blank">Visa</a>. I first joined as a member of the 2nd cohort of Visa's HR Development Program, and then grew into strategy-based roles within the Global Talent team. During my time at Visa, I was most proud of redesigning our strategy and approach to employee recognition, doubling quarterly usage of our recognition platform from 31% to 76%.</p>
            <p>I'm drawn to opportunities where I can uncover stories hidden in data. I also enjoy working on presentations more than I'd like to admit.</p>

            <h2>I find joy in <span class="highlight">reading.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>I've made it a habit to read before bed every night instead of scrolling on my phone. I usually read two books at a time, one fiction and one non-fiction, so I can go back and forth between them depending on my mood. I read on a Kindle Paperwhite, and I use <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby" target="_blank">Libby</a> to borrow all of my books.</p>
            <p>Here are some books I've read that left a particularly deep mark on me:</p>

        <div id="movement">
            <h2>I find joy in <span class="highlight">movement.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>I spent most of my life being terrified of fitness, so I feel really lucky to have found ways to be physically active that I genuinely love.</p>
            <p>I've done yoga on and off for about five years. You can find me every Saturday at my neighborhood yoga studio, <a href="https://www.yogamayu.com" target="_blank">Yoga Mayu</a>. I also highly recommend <a href="https://haumsf.com" target="_blank">HAUM SF</a>, which is the most beautiful space I've ever practiced in.</p>
            <p>In 2021, I started doing pole and developed a moderate obsession. I take classes three times per week, so if I'm not at home, I'm most likely at my studio. I continue to be surprised by what my body is capable of, and I'm really proud of the upper body strength I've developed.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>I find joy in <span class="highlight">lots of other random things.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <li>I'm a sucker for miniature things</li>
            <li>I'm also a sucker for kitschy things - one of my most prized possessions is a popsicle purse from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rommydebommy/" target="_blank">Rommy de Bommy</a>, which I unfortunately broke during a move</li>
            <li>Like many others, I learned how to knit during the pandemic</li>
            <li>Unlike many others, I finally learned how to ride a bike during the pandemic (although I haven't ridden much since and honestly might have forgotten how to)</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, I find the energy to host an overly elaborate dinner for friends. These events have escalated rapidly, with the last dinner taking the form of a pop-up ramen restaurant in my apartment, complete with 2 different types of broth made from scratch, QR code menus, and me taking orders on an iPad</li>
            <li>I started learning Mandarin in 2022 and take lessons with a tutor twice a week (<span id="chinese">可是我的中文還說的不好</span>)</li>
            <li>I use <a href="https://www.ynab.com" target="_blank">YNAB</a> and am a big fan</li>
            <li>When I want some background noise, I usually look for video essays on Youtube (four-hour deep-dives on teen sitcoms from the 00's are my guilty pleasure)</li>
